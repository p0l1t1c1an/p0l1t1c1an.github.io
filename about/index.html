                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                I'm a Cybersecurity Engineering senior at Iowa State University who loves learning 
                about technology and security. I just started being a homelab enthusiast and have been 
                a Unix buff since high school. At the moment, I only have an OPNsense router, Cisco switch,
                and Dell Poweredge running Proxmox for VMs, which create a kubernetes cluster.  
                As well, I love to program especially in Rust, C, or Python and enjoy figuring out how systems 
                work from a bottom-up approach.
                </p>

                <h2>Career Goals</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                There are a few fields in IT and security that I am particularly interested. 
                They mostly hit one of my interests of development and cybersecurity.
                </p>
                <ul> 
                    <li>Security Analyst</li>
                    <li>DevOps / Software Engineering</li>
                    <li>Application / Product Security</li>
                    <li>Cloud Security</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>

                <h2>Certificates</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                I currently don't have any IT or security certificates. I am planning on getting many once 
                I graduate. Much of my coursework covers many baseline security, network, and cloud certificates.
                The main ones I am looking at getting are:
                </p>
                <ul> 
                    <li>SEC+ or GIAC Security Essentials Certificate (GSEC)</li>
                    <li>NET+ or CCNA</li>
                    <li>AWS Solutions Architect</li>
                    <li>CySA+ or GIAC Certified Incident Handler (GCIH)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                My coursework can be viewed one of my
                <a href="https://github.com/p0l1t1c1an/IAState-Classwork">github repos</a>
                that go over everything I have taken and some of the content from those course.

                <h2>Music</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                Outside of tech, I am a big music head and am always listening to something: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dubstep</li>
                    <li>Electro Swing</li>
                    <li>Funk and Jazz</li>
                    <li>And a ton of Video Game Music</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                Though, the best is rock. I listen to about every genre. My favorite being:
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Folk Rock</li>
                    <li>Grunge and Punk</li>
                    <li>Orchestral Rock</li>
                    <li>Progressive Rock and Psycodelia</li>
                    <li>And Funk/Jazz Rock Fusion</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Contact Me</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                If you want to reach me, my contacts are linked to the three icons at the top of the web page.
                Though, I would just assume that what you're sending me is public information.
